## Introduction
The PERN Todo project is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage their todo tasks. It is built using the PERN stack, which includes PostgreSQL for the database, Express.js for the backend server, React.js for the frontend, and Node.js as the runtime environment.

## Features
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) todo tasks
- User authentication and authorization
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- RESTful API for backend communication

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Other:** Axios for HTTP requests, JWT for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- PostgreSQL installed and running

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PERN_todo.git
   cd PERN_todo
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up the PostgreSQL database:**
   - Create a database named `pern_todo`
   - Run the SQL script located in `server/database/schema.sql` to create the necessary tables

5. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the [`server`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2FKaran%2FDesktop%2FProjects%2FPERN%2FPERN_TO_DO%2Fserver%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22ee73f408-53b2-4b3f-a220-d7c381735a52%22%5D "c:\Users\Karan\Desktop\Projects\PERN\PERN_TO_DO\server") directory with the following content:
     ```
     PORT=5000
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/pern_todo
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     ```

6. **Start the backend server:**
   ```sh
   cd ../server
   npm start
   ```

7. **Start the frontend development server:**
   ```sh
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```
